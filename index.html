    <h1>Self-Working Card Tricks</h1>

    <h2>Double Force (Hindu Shuffle Force, False Cut Force)</h2>
    <p>Setup: Get your desired card at the bottom of deck 1, and at the top of deck 2</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>False shuffle deck 1 a few times, making sure that you preserve the bottom card. Perform a hindu shuffle, taking the bottom of the deck in the dominant hand, and allowing the top to fall to the palm of the non-dominant hand. Begin taking cards off the top, making it non-obvious that you are taking from the top only. Ask for someone to tell you when to stop. When they tell you to stop, show the card as the bottom of the pile in the dominant hand, which will be the force card. Announce that this is the "chosen card", and that you will need to find it in deck 2</li>
        <li>Falsely shuffle deck 2, ensuring to preserve the top card. Rifle through the deck, asking someone to tell you when to stop. When they tell you to stop, cut the deck at that location, and place the cut portion over the top of the deck sideways. Do some talking. Then, take off the top sideways stack, and show that the top card of the bottom pile is the same as the "prediction card"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Four Aces</h2>
    <p>Setup: Remove all four aces. Place a black ace on top and bottom of the deck</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional: False shuffle the deck, preserving the top and bottom card). Hand the two red aces to your spectator</li>
        <li>Start dealing cards from the top of the face-down deck, and tell them to say stop whenever they want. When they say stop, have them place a red ace face-up to mark the spot, and put the rest of the deck on top</li>
        <li>Start dealing again. Ask them to stop whenever. Place the other ace face-up, and place the rest of the deck on top</li>
        <li>Spread the deck out, and show them that each of their red aces have black aces on top of them</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Four Sevens</h2>
    <p>Setup: Get all four 7s from the deck. Put one on top of the deck (position 1), one at position 7, and then put the other two 7s at positions 7 and 8 from the bottom.</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Nonchalantly rifle through the deck, and pick out the 7th card, which will be your "prediction card" </li>
        <li>Turn the deck over, and start placing down cards face-up. Make sure you are past the two loaded 7s, and then ask someone to tell you when to stop</li>
        <li>When they tell you to stop, place the remainder of the deck face down. Then turn over the face-up counted pile, and place it face-down as well </li>
        <li>Say that the top card of the original deck will be your "index" card. It will be the 7 placed on top of the deck at the start. Count 7 cards, and turn over the 7. Then proceed to reveal that the next card is a 7, and the prediction card is a 7.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Variation 1: Use a 4, 5, and 6 instead of the three other 7's. Place the 6 at the "prediction card" spot. Place the 4 and 5 at the 7th and 8th positions from the bottom, respectively. "If that is a 4, and this is a 5, then this must be a 6 - 4, 5, 6, 7"</p>

    <h2>Flip Deck Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: Take three cards, and turn them around face-down at the bottom of the deck</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Flip the deck over so that 49 of the cards are face down. Get a spectator to pick a card. While they are looking at it, flip the deck in your hand</li>
        <li>Place the card back into the center of the deck</li>
        <li>Show first card face up (not their card), second card face up (not their card), then push over a clump of cards to show that they have all turned face up, except for the chosen card</li>
    </ol>
