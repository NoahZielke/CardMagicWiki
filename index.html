    <!-- <h2>Double Force (Hindu Shuffle Force, False Cut Force)</h2>
    <p>Setup: Get your desired card at the bottom of deck 1, and at the top of deck 2</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>False shuffle deck 1 a few times, making sure that you preserve the bottom card. Perform a hindu shuffle, taking the bottom of the deck in the dominant hand, and allowing the top to fall to the palm of the non-dominant hand. Begin taking cards off the top, making it non-obvious that you are taking from the top only. Ask for someone to tell you when to stop. When they tell you to stop, show the card as the bottom of the pile in the dominant hand, which will be the force card. Announce that this is the "chosen card", and that you will need to find it in deck 2</li>
        <li>Falsely shuffle deck 2, ensuring to preserve the top card. Rifle through the deck, asking someone to tell you when to stop. When they tell you to stop, cut the deck at that location, and place the cut portion over the top of the deck sideways. Do some talking. Then, take off the top sideways stack, and show that the top card of the bottom pile is the same as the "prediction card"</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <h2>6s and 9s Deck Throw</h2>
    <p>Setup: Put the 9 of spades on the bottom of the deck, and the 6 of clubs on the top</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle through the deck with the deck turned toward yourself, and pull out the 6 of spades and 9 of clubs</li>
        <li>Show the cards briefly, calling them the "black nine and black six", before handing them face-down to your spectator</li>
        <li>Ask your spectator to place them into the center of the deck. Before pushing them in, "examine" their positions (i.e., "That looks like maybe 15... and 38")</li>
        <li>Then perform a deck throw where you hold on to only the top and bottom cards when throwing the cards into the other hand. The two cards will be a different black six and nine, but just call them "our cards"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Card Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: None</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have a spectator shuffle the deck</li>
        <li>Have the spectator pick a card. When they have it, extend your hand to them (misdirection) and tell them to memorize it. Peek at the bottom card in your deck</li>
        <li>Place the deck on the table, and tell them to place their card on top. Then, perform a few quick cuts of the deck to "mix it in". Your key card is now on top of theirs</li>
        <li>Continue to hold the deck face down. Tell them that you are going to start dealing cards from the top, and they should watch for their card. Tell them if they see their card, they should try not to react at all</li>
        <li>Deal from the top, turning over cards, until you see the key card. Keep dealing 2 or 3 more cards as if nothing happened</li>
        <li>Hold the next card, and ask them, "Would it be amazing if the next card that I turned over was your card?", when they say yes, take their card from the pile - which is the card you dealt after the key card - and turn it over</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nine Card Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: (Optional: Have a sensible 4 or 5 letter word in mind, tied to the situation, i.e., the person's name)</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask a spectator to pick a random card, and place it face-up</li>
        <li>Take nine random cards from the deck</li>
        <li>Deal them into three piles of three, spaced so that each can be seen face-down</li>
        <li>Ask a spectator to pick a card. Pick up the other two piles when they are looking at their card. When they hand you their card, place it on the bottom of the last pile of 2 cards, and place that pile on top of the other cards, so that their chosen card is third from the top</li>
        <li>Deal the cards by spelling out the card picked in step 1 as follows - For each word (e.g., "ace" in "ace of spades"), deal a card for each letter. When finished with the word, place the remaining cards on top of the ones dealt. Then, count out 5 more, and the 5th card will always be their card</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Flip Deck Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: Take three cards, and turn them around face-down at the bottom of the deck</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Flip the deck over so that 49 of the cards are face down. Get a spectator to pick a card. While they are looking at it, flip the deck in your hand</li>
        <li>Place the card back into the center of the deck</li>
        <li>Show first card face up (not their card), second card face up (not their card), then push over a clump of cards to show that they have all turned face up, except for the chosen card</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Four Sevens</h2>
    <p>Setup: Get all four 7s from the deck. Put one on top of the deck (position 1), one at position 7, and then put the other two 7s at positions 7 and 8 from the bottom.</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Nonchalantly rifle through the deck, and pick out the 7th card, which will be your "prediction card" </li>
        <li>Turn the deck over, and start placing down cards face-up. Make sure you are past the two loaded 7s, and then ask someone to tell you when to stop</li>
        <li>When they tell you to stop, place the remainder of the deck face down. Then turn over the face-up counted pile, and place it face-down as well </li>
        <li>Ask them to pick a deck. If they pick the original deck, turn over the top card as your "index" card. If they pick the other, do the same, but that will be your "counting deck". The top card will be the 7 placed on top of the deck at the start. Count 7 cards, and turn over the 7. Then proceed to reveal that the next card is a 7, and the prediction card is a 7.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Variation 1: Use a 4, 5, and 6 instead of the three other 7's. Place the 6 at the "prediction card" spot. Place the 4 and 5 at the 7th and 8th positions from the bottom, respectively. "If that is a 4, and this is a 5, then this must be a 6 - 4, 5, 6, 7"</p>

    <!-- <h2>Four Aces</h2>
    <p>Setup: Remove all four aces. Place a black ace on top and bottom of the deck</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional: False shuffle the deck, preserving the top and bottom card). Hand the two red aces to your spectator</li>
        <li>Start dealing cards from the top of the face-down deck, and tell them to say stop whenever they want. When they say stop, have them place a red ace face-up to mark the spot, and put the rest of the deck on top</li>
        <li>Start dealing again. Ask them to stop whenever. Place the other ace face-up, and place the rest of the deck on top</li>
        <li>Spread the deck out, and show them that each of their red aces have black aces on top of them</li>
    </ol>

    <hr> -->

    <h2>Aces and Kings</h2>
    <p>Setup: Put the four kings on top of the deck. Remove the aces from the deck</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional: False shuffle the deck, preserving the top four cards)</li>
        <li>Deal the top four cards into four piles, and give your spectator 4 aces</li>
        <li>Deal cards into each pile, telling the spectator to tell you when to stop for each, and place an ace face-up on top of the pile</li>
        <li>When all aces are on top of the piles, combine them into one pile by placing them on top of each other</li>
        <li>Cut the deck once, trying to get a face-down card on top</li>
        <li>Fan the face-down deck out on the table (bottom to top), and reveal that each of the aces now has a king to its right</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Thirteen Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: None</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Deal the entire deck into piles, aiming for the value 13. The first card you deal will determine where you start the count. If it is a king, deal no extra cards. If it is an ace, deal 12 extra cards. If it is a 5, deal 8 more cards. Etc. When you do not have enough to make another pile, put the remaining cards to the side </li>
        <li>Select three piles, preferably none of which just have one or two cards. Gather up the other piles, plus the extras from step 1 into a single deck</li>
        <li>Deal 10 cards (you can say 13 minus 3 piles is 10). Have a spectator turn over the top card of two of the piles. Deal the number of cards equal to their values, e.g., a 5 and a 7 would deal another 12 cards</li>
        <li>Reveal that the number of cards that you have left is the value of the last face-down pile's top card</li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h2>Natural Stripper Deck</h2>
    <p>Setup: Take out all the asymmetrical cards in the deck - cards which have more suit icons facing up in one orientation/weighted to one side of the face - 3 (all except the diamond) of the aces, 3s, 5s, 6s, 8s, 9s, and all four 7s. (Optional: You can also add one face card). Turn all cards so that the majority of their icons are right side up/at the top of the card</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle the cards, preserving their orientation</li>
        <li>Have your spectator pick a card, and memorize it. Turn the deck in your hands one time naturally in your hands as they look </li>
        <li>When they place the card back in, make sure to pinch the deck so that it does not go all the way in. If they have turned the orientation of the card, you will need to turn it when you square the deck (Tip: To keep track, always turn the deck in your hand. When they choose a card, imagine the bottom of the card is glowing blue. You need that glowing blue end to be at the bottom when they replace the card in the deck)</li>
        <li>Shuffle and cut the deck, again preserving the cards' orientation</li>
        <li>Fan out the cards on the table, and make a show of looking for it. You are looking for the card with a mismatched orientation. (If you chose to add an optional face card, if all the cards are the same orientation, they chose the face card). Reveal their card</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Variation 1: Do this trick on the fly by "randomly" grabbing and orienting about 10 cards</p>

    <h2>Bill Simon's Prophecy Move Sorted Deck</h2>
    <p>Setup: Have a deck in new deck order</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Have a spectator pick a card. When they pick one, ask if they are sure, holding the two parts of the deck above and below their selection in each hand. When you bring the deck together, reverse the top and bottom. Now the card above their selection is on the bottom of the deck, and the card below their selection is on the top</li>
        <li>Ask them to insert the card into the deck anywhere they want to. They will (most likely) assume that it will need to be put in face-down. Tell them that it needs to be face-up, performing the Bill Simon's prophecy move. If they place it in face-up, you can switch it to be face-down</li>
        <li>Reveal that they placed the card exactly where it was to begin</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Card Tricks that May Fail (But Usually Don't)</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Face Card Card Find</h2>
    <p>Setup: Get all the face cards, and place them at the top of the deck. Remember the topmost card as a key card. Make sure you tell your spectator what a riffle shuffle is</p>
    <p>Performance:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Deal the top 12 cards (without counting them), and give them a shuffle, controlling your key card to remain as the top card. Then, begin dealing them face-down, starting with the top card, and ask your spectator to stop you whenever they want to</li>
        <li>When they have picked a stopping card, ask them to memorize it, and place the rest of the deck face-down on the table. Tell them to put their choice on top of the deck face-down when they are done, and then place the face cards face-down on top. Your key card will be over their selection</li>
        <li>Ask them to riffle shuffle the deck. Ask them to do it again. This is mixing the face cards throughout the deck so that it looks less suspicious</li>
        <li>Turn over the cards, and fan them out bottom-first on the table, and make a show of discarding various segments of the deck until you find their card, which will (most likely) be the first face card to the right of the key card</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Failure case: When the second shuffle puts a face card between your key card and their card. You will know this may have happened if you get 3 face cards in a row, one of which is your key card</p>
    <p>To avoid failure completely: Only allow them to riffle shuffle one time. If you do this, you may have to use a less conspicuous set of cards than the face cards for your selected cards</p>
